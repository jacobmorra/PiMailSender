# PiMailSender
An application created for the purpose of practicing with the Linux shell, Python, and the Raspberry Pi 2. 
The application consists of a script which sends mail to a dummy email after a button is physically pressed 
on a breadboard attached to my Raspberry Pi. 

## Next steps
1. Adding a script for sending the email in response to a physical button press
2. Interfacing with a camera
  1. Install camera
  2. Implement tracking of moving objects in front of camera
  3. send an email to me if movement is detected
