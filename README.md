# pi-security_cam
An application created for the purpose of practicing with the Linux shell, Python, and the Raspberry Pi 2. 
###Phase 1:
The application consists of a script which sends mail to a dummy email after a button is physically pressed 
on a breadboard attached to my Raspberry Pi. 

###Phase 2:
Using OpenCV, a script is used to detect a person in front of the pi camera as s/he moves about the room. An
email (phase 1) is sent from the Raspberry Pi to inform me that someone has been detected

## Next steps
1. Testing with different lighting conditions and optimizing
2. The camera emails me the actual image
